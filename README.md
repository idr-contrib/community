# Welcome to the IDR developers forum

The [Image Data Resource (IDR)](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/) is a public data repository that stores, integrates and serves image
datasets from published scientific studies. All data is completely open and available through a
[published API](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/about/api.html).

If you have any questions on how to use the Image Data Repository, including any of the tools or components related to the IDR, please
[open an issue in this repository](https://github.com/idr-contrib/community/issues).
